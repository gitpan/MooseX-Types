Revision history for MooseX-Types

0.22    Tue Jun  1 20:10:12 CEST 2010
        - Update docs to mention MRO::Compat rather than Class::C3.
        - Added '0+' overloading to solve the type constraint equality
          regression introduced when Moose 1.05 tightened the rules
          determing type constraint equality.  Added tests for the
          regression.

0.21    Thu Dec 24 00:21:26 EST 2009
        - Attempting to import a non-existent type from a combined type
          library gave a very confusing error message from the
          MooseX::Types::Combined internals. Now it gives you a much more
          useful message. (Dave Rolsky)
        - bump up Moose dep (RT#53016)

0.20    Thu Sep 10 22:34:48 EDT 2009
        - fix "empty export" warning (doy).

0.19    Sun Aug 23 15:03:02 EDT 2009
        - un-fix coercions on parameterized types, since it broke
          MooseX::Method::Signatures, as well as any other code that relied on
          new type constraint objects being generated each time a type was
          parameterized (hdp).

0.18    Sat Aug 22 12:50:42 EDT 2009
        - fix coercions on parameterized types (Hans Dieter Pearcey).

0.17    Tue Aug 18 02:32:31 EDT 2009
        - Documentation typo fix (Dave Rolsky).
        - Stop blowing up in has_available_type_export if the introspected code
          symbol exists but is not a type export (Florian Ragwitz).
        - Reorganize author/copyright sections at the request of Debian
          packagers (Rafael Kitover).

0.16    Mon Jun 29 10:50:41 PDT 2009
        - Ship with Module::Install 0.91

0.15    Sun Jun 27 15:50:00 EDT 2009
        - Change all uses of croak in TypeDecorator to use the Moose
          throw_exception method.
        - More test cases for the union mixed string type issue, and
          better handling of this in the | overload in TypeDecorator

0.14    Fri Jun 26 17:52:20 PDT 2009
        - Fix union with string type

0.13    Tue Jun 23 05:46:33 PDT 2009
        - Add Test::Moose to build_requires for Fedora

0.12    Sun Jun 14 14:39:57 PDT 2009
        - fix mixing of typelibs with regular Moose classes

0.11    Sat May 23 18:02:35 PDT 2009
        - warning on string types and unregistered class/role types
        - better error for missing comma
        - MooseX::Types::Combine for combining type libs

0.10    Fri March 06 17:34:00 EST 2009
        - Removed unneeded debugging code from one of the tests, which was
          causing installation errors for people that didn't already have
          Data::Dump installed. (jjnapiork)
0.09    ...
        - Added MooseX::Types::Util::has_available_type_export($p, $n) to
          allow introspection of available types for other libraries wanting
          to use type export names for type specifications.

0.08    Mon Dec  09 19:00:00 EST 2008
        - Added experimental support for recursive type constraints.  Pod and
          tests for this feature.  Let the madness begin.
        - Documentation updates.
        - Workaround test case for the SUb::Exporter compatibility issue.  Also
          documented in Pod.

0.07    Fri Oct  07 23:00:00 EST 2008
        - Bumped minimum allowed Moose version to fix problem with overloading
          on some versions of Perl
        - Tiny documentation updates.

0.06    Fri Oct  24 15:00:00 EST 2008
        - Added support for parameterized types and type unions, tests for all
        that and documentation updates.

0.05    [Indetermined]
        - moved export mechanism to Sub::Exporter. ::Base contains
          a bunch of wrapping logic to allow the export-along functionality
          for the helper symbols
        - removed vestigial load of Sub::UpLevel since it breaks
          the argument display in confess()

0.04    Thu Aug  9 20:56:14 CEST 2007
        - Automatically set strict and warnings like Moose does

0.03    Thu Aug  9 14:41:58 CEST 2007
        - Minor POD typo correction
        - Added some error messages for wrong type names
        - Coercion handler not exported without type object
        - Moved from Class::Inspector to Class::MOP::load_class

0.02    Wed Aug  8 20:33:42 CEST 2007
        - Changed declaration to croak when it sees '::' in a typename

0.01    Wed Aug  8 18:19:34 CEST 2007
        - Initial release
